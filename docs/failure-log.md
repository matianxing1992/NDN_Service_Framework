# Failure Log and Evidence Index

This is the repository-level index for failed, blocked, and `UNQUALIFIED`
attempts. It is an engineering memory, not a replacement for the active Spec,
the source tree, or a raw run directory.

## Read-first rule

At the start of every substantial task, read the newest entry in this file and
open its durable evidence record. If the entry names a raw log under the
ignored workspace temporary directory, inspect that log with targeted
`rg`/`tail` queries before choosing the next command. Then read the applicable
documents in
[`architecture-reading-guide.md`](architecture-reading-guide.md).

A failed preflight, startup barrier, or evidence collector is not a protocol
result. Do not retry a later gate, reuse a candidate, or claim a PASS until the
failure's controlling boundary and invalidation effect are understood.

## Current failure index

**Spec181 local gate identity R1 (2026-09-06): BLOCK at source authority.**
The real local gate accepts a fixture root without a Git HEAD and an invented
40-character sourceRevision, then reports PASS for six fixture children.
All six exits/cleanup records are collected; no network qualification ran.
Validate actual checkout/source identity before any qualification child or
output directory is created, then retain focused regressions for rejection.
See [local gate identity](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t007-local-gate-identity-20260906.md).

**Spec181 native plan closure R1 (2026-09-06): BLOCK at projection behavior.**
Twelve missing header lines close the maintained local native build, including
the extension import/identity check. Focused plan/merge tests then yield
27 PASS / 2 FAIL: COMPONENT_SET postprocessing is rejected, and two PIPELINE
tensors collide in runtime scope with mismatched producer/consumer names.
Preserve R1 before applying the exact parser/scope repair; no qualification
matrix or model run was started.
R2 closes the parser/scope unit: 29 cases / 133 assertions PASS, including
unchanged transport authorization groups. Refresh native identity from its
source checkpoint before advancing the remaining A05 candidate/config audit.
See [native plan closure](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t007-native-plan-closure-20260906.md).

**Spec181 native source diagnostic R3 (2026-09-06): BLOCK at DI projection declaration.**
A checkout refusal left the first native retry on the prior HEAD plus an
explicit source patch; that run is invalid as clean-commit evidence. It
terminated with two compiler errors: NativeCanonicalOnnxAssembler reads
canonicalArtifactName absent from the committed NativeSelectionProjectionV3.
The nine tested files were then matched to 1df718c8 and checkout completed.
Inspect the declaration and assignment path before a fresh recorded retry.
See [framework source closure](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t007-framework-source-closure-20260906.md).

**Spec181 framework source closure R1 (2026-09-06): BLOCK at assignment metadata.**
The isolated six-file dependency closure builds the production framework
library. Its reused lifecycle/assignment checks yield 16 PASS / 1 FAIL:
ServiceProvider loses artifactDataName while projecting a structured
assignment set into CollaborationContext. Preserve the R1 source patch and
result, then close the exact Provider transfer before retrying.
R2 carries the root name through single/structured assignments and rejects
conflicting roots. The isolated target links and passes 26 cases / 204
assertions. This framework boundary is closed; full native closure remains.
See [framework source closure](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t007-framework-source-closure-20260906.md).

**Spec181 committed native build R4 (2026-09-05): BLOCK at C++ source closure.**
Clean 6c7a0b23 passes configuration and Waf graph creation, then ServiceUser.cpp
fails to compile: AckAuthenticationEvidence is missing, followed by missing
registration and publish-result declarations. The implementation depends on
uncommitted framework declarations/companions. Preserve R4 and close those
exact dependencies before the next clean build; no protocol result exists.
See [committed native closure](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t007-committed-native-build-20260905.md).

**Spec181 committed native build (2026-09-05): BLOCK at Waf graph creation.**
Detached d67de87a configures successfully, but tests/wscript references an
untracked native assembly integration source. find_node returns None and Waf
fails before C++ compilation. No protocol result exists; preserve the isolated
checkout and repair the committed source dependency before retrying.
One focused identity regression also fails: changing loaded tests/wscript
bytes with unchanged mtime does not invalidate the native receipt, because
that Waf control file is missing from source fingerprints.
R2 binds the missing control file (70 identity checks PASS) and builds the
integration target, but its seven named assembly cases yield 3 PASS / 4 FAIL.
All four fail at certified recipe_digest validation before ORT loading;
preserve R2 and compare fixture serialization with the production contract.
R3 corrects the old fixture's quoted integer dimensions, leaving production
digest validation intact: 7 cases / 160 assertions PASS. The missing test
source and identity repair are ready for a checkpoint; a fresh committed
checkout must still pass the maintained native build. T007 remains BLOCK.
See [committed native closure](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t007-committed-native-build-20260905.md).

**Spec181 A05 qualification inventory (2026-09-05): CLOSED within focused inventory repair.**
The inherited inventory requires Q-C/Q-W but discovers only Spec180 Python
tests, omitting Spec181 protected-grant regressions. Two tests using the real
inventory builder and pytest collection fail; no formal network run started.
R2 repairs those cases (15 PASS); an old count assertion is corrected, and R3
passes 16 checks. R4 then exposes a second boundary: two tests show rehashed
case-source substitution is accepted by the real builder and gate. These use
fixture children, not a network qualification. Preserve R4 before repair.
R5 rejects both substitutions (17 PASS); the old missing-oracle fixture also
changed its source path and is now correctly rejected earlier. R6 keeps the
registered path while withholding its oracle to preserve that check's scope.
R6 passes 18 checks. R7 then finds three unsafe entry IDs accepted by the
validator although the gate joins IDs into output directories; no escaped
write is attempted. Reject these IDs at the inventory boundary before R8.
R8 passes all 21 checks: active scope/collection, registered case source/args,
safe entry IDs, existing evidence/oracle controls and wrapper compatibility.
The remaining A05 native/candidate effective-configuration audit stays BLOCK.
See [qualification scope repair](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t007-qualification-scope-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T007 evidence inventory (2026-09-05): CLOSED within document inventory scope.**
The R003 record reports zero Spec181 evidence files, while the current tree
contains 37. Four active evidence records lack an explicit header layer, and
the audit body still describes already-closed T002/shared-runtime gaps. This
invalidates the old completeness claim, not the linked raw test results.
Four layer headers are repaired; the current inventory covers 145 entries,
including both audit roots and one explicit SELF row. Drift/structure checks
PASS, and all 105 Spec180 evidence-file hashes match the before-scan. Raw scan:
ignored workspace temporary directory `spec181-evidence-inventory-20260905-r1/`.
See [complete inventory](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t007-evidence-inventory-20260905.md).

**Spec181 shared generation worker (2026-09-05): CLOSED by focused repair.**
Two queued coordinator regressions entered the model after cancellation or
deadline. The existing pre-run cancellation check passed (1/3 cases PASS,
14/18 assertions PASS). Propagating the shared guard through the registered
runtime/worker and state staging repairs the boundary: rebuilt 48 cases /
366 assertions PASS. T007 remains BLOCK for its remaining audit obligations.
See [generation worker authority](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t007-generation-worker-20260905.md).

**Spec181 shared preparation control R1 (2026-09-05): CLOSED as startup error; R2 focused PASS.**
The isolated launcher omitted the empty output directory; `validate_inputs`
raised `OUTPUT_ROOT_MISSING` before MiniNDN startup. No protocol result exists.
The unified native build passed. R1 is preserved; fresh R2 passed the protected
P-256 control with four verified Providers and seven collected child exits.
See [shared preparation closure](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t002-shared-preparation-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T002 native handler observation (2026-09-05): CLOSED; early result INVALID.** A focused test
was started before the repair build completed and ran the previous binary.
R2/green.log is preserved. The original build completed (59.612s), then the rebuilt
binary passed 46 cases / 242 assertions in a new log. The early result is a
validation orchestration error, not a protocol result.
See [native handler closure](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t002-native-handler-closure-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T002 native prepared output binding (2026-09-05): CLOSED (focused repair).** The production
prepared-runner validator accepts a Merge output budget changed from the sealed
Selection's K=300 to K=1. R1 fails one of two assertions after a passing positive
control. Exact output shape/type binding now rejects the mutation; rebuilt focused
checks pass 46 cases / 242 assertions. Source closure remains pending; see
[native handler closure](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t002-native-handler-closure-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T002 native Merge contract (2026-09-05): CLOSED (focused repair).** Direct production-runner
checks pass the numerical controls but expose four missed rejections: unknown
postprocess identity, numeric suffix, trailing shape delimiter, and wrong output
dtype. R1 is preserved (3/6 cases, 22/26 assertions passed). Rebuilt repairs pass
6 cases / 26 assertions; related evidence/readiness checks total 10 cases / 69
assertions. Handler source closure remains open; see
[native Merge closure](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t002-native-merge-closure-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T002 native worker authority (2026-09-05): CLOSED (focused repair).** Four real-worker
regressions show that cancellation/expiry after preparation or during compute
still returns results and retains the registered plaintext lease. Grant
verification is valid initially; the missing boundary is worker consumption.
R1 is preserved. Request guards now fence preparation, compute, cached results,
events, publication, and return; rebuilt focused checks pass 51 cases / 280 assertions.
T002 source closure and unified production rebuild remain open; see [worker authority](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t002-worker-authority-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T001 request lifecycle (2026-09-05): CLOSED.** Twelve registered-handler
regressions show that cancellation or Selection deadline expiry before/during
grant fetch or after preparation still reaches model execution. Grant expiry
alone does not enforce request lifetime. Preserve the first red run before
repair. Four final regressions also expose a missing comparison between the
grant-reference and Selection policy snapshot. Both repairs pass 151 focused
regressions and six real Python process cases (24 exits collected). All red
runs are preserved. T001 acceptance is complete; T002/T007 remain open. See
[request lifecycle](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t001-request-lifecycle-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T001/T002 maintained process integration (2026-09-05): focused defects CLOSED.**
R1 native fixtures build, but NFD's own management FIB registration fails
because the test configuration omits management authorization. The requester
then receives connection refused; no grant verification occurred. Preserve
the r1 raw run. R2 fixes NFD but requester bootstrap requires a real Controller
for NAC public parameters. Separately, ten successful P-256 runtime calls leak
24560 bytes / 630 allocations under ASAN despite the Zeroized state. Both
boundaries are recorded before repair. R3 fixes the EC ownership leak: ten
P-256 calls pass ASAN. The real Controller becomes ready, but requester
publication readiness times out before any Provider result; preserve r3
before instrumenting that boundary. R4 NDN logs/stack locate the wait in
ServiceUser construction (NAC decryption key): the fixture needs its own
requester policy and certificate bootstrap. R5 passes five cases; Python's
wrong-recipient rejection is correct, but the test incorrectly requires a
Core wire prefix on an internal typed exception. Preserve r5 and correct
the scoped assertion without synthesizing a Core response. R6 passes all 11
checks (10 real-process cases plus ASAN), with all 40 child exits collected.
T001/T002 full acceptance and T007 remain open. See
[process integration](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t001-t002-process-integration-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T002 P-256 production path (2026-09-05): focused defects CLOSED.**
R1 proves the runner overwrites an explicitly configured recipient-key map
with the Ed25519 offer-key map. Four other checks stop in fixture key
generation because this cryptography installation requires an explicit backend;
they do not prove a production refusal. R2 fixes the fixture: three actual
entry regressions fail (requester loader, Python Provider loader, map override),
and two wrong-curve rejection checks pass. R3 repairs those entries: 130 checks
pass, but the positive P-256 case reaches the production envelope creator and
fails because its EC key generation also omits the required backend argument.
All three raw results are retained. R4 repairs the production key generation;
134 focused checks pass, including bounded private-file rejection. The unified
native rebuild and a fresh four-recipient P-256 Y-B control pass: four native
grant verifications, terminal numerical match, seven collected child exits,
and empty staging. Full T001/T002 acceptance remains open.
See [P-256 production path](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t002-p256-production-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T002 recipient credentials (2026-09-05): focused defect CLOSED.**
The production factory accepts only Ed25519 private keys although T002 and
the native verifier also support EC P-256 envelopes. The rebuilt credential
regression runs eight cases; only P-256 loading fails before grant acquisition
with `provider recipient private key is not Ed25519`. The r1 build and RED
logs are retained. R2 loads validated P-256 PEM through the production loader;
all eight focused checks pass, including wrong-curve and permission rejection.
P-256 network acceptance and full T002 closure remain open. See
[recipient credentials](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t002-recipient-credentials-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T002 helper lifecycle (2026-09-05): focused lifecycle defects CLOSED.**
The native assembler waits synchronously for its helper, ignores request and
operation deadlines during assembly, observes grant cancellation/expiry only
after slow work, and can activate helper output beyond the role envelope.
Six real-process regression failures are retained in
`spec181-t002-helper-20260905-r1/red.log` in the ignored workspace temporary
directory. R2 builds but 14 native checks stop at the loader: the old installed
framework lacks `streamCancelled`. R3 binds the test executable and its
environment to the current build library: 26 focused checks pass. A new
source-fetch cancellation regression then proves that the parent recreates
the erased plaintext directory. R4 serializes protected staging writes
with runtime cleanup; 27 focused checks pass, including the new race. The
new RED log is retained in r3. The final unified native rebuild and a fresh
protected Y-B control pass: four actual grant verifications, three ORT CPU
roles plus native Merge, verified terminal output, and empty staging after
all seven child exits are collected. Full T002 acceptance remains in progress. See
[T002 helper lifecycle](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t002-helper-lifecycle-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T003 assembly parity (2026-09-05): focused build defects CLOSED.**
The fixed-vector Python lane passes 8 cases; the native lane fails 8 checks
because its required current-source test executable is not built yet. This
is a test-input boundary, not an assembly or protocol rejection. R2 compile
also fails before execution because the manual command omitted the installed
NAC-ABE package's `NAC_ABE_CMAKE_BUILD` definition. R3 also lacks the maintained
framework include path; r4 replaces the manual command with a focused Waf
target using the existing dependency configuration. R4 compiles but exposes
the framework's NDNSD link dependency; r5 adds that configured dependency.
R5 build passes; the final 19 parity checks pass, including real ORT CPU
execution and unchanged negative-cache state. Fixed-vector regeneration is
byte-identical. T003 is complete at its focused scope; T007 remains BLOCK. Preserve
`spec181-t003-assembly-20260905-r1` and build the production-entry fixture
before another attempt. See
[T003 assembly parity](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t003-assembly-parity-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T005 evidence preservation (2026-09-05): focused defects CLOSED.**
Five focused checks expose the legacy driver's destructive attempt handling,
runtime-dependent entry, and continuation after matrix failures. No network
processes are started. The repair retires this unsafe automatic retry path
and makes the maintained matrix stop at its first failed subcase. Raw RED
output is retained under `spec181-t005-evidence-repair-20260905-r1` in the
ignored workspace temporary directory. R2 passes 118 focused checks after
retiring the legacy entry and stopping on the first matrix failure. This is
not formal matrix qualification; T005 remains NOT PROVEN. See
[T005 evidence repair](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t005-evidence-repair-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T006 positive control (2026-09-05): cold dependency timeout CLOSED.**
All four native grants verify, but r8 Merge's first tensor-manifest fetch
expires at the fixed 10 s no-progress bound while its producer finishes cold
model preparation. User then times out. The three actual grant negatives
pass. After binding the data wait to the configured request budget while
retaining the existing hard deadline and cancellation, r10 completes the
protected native control; a measured dependency wait is 13.97 s. The final
r11/r12/r13 negatives also pass with complete process collection. T006 is
complete at its focused scope; T007 remains BLOCK. See
[T006 production repair](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t006-production-repair-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T006 production rejection (2026-09-05): false-positive oracle CLOSED.**
Eight focused regressions fail: the configured requester seam publishes no
mutation, invalid mutation/epoch settings are admitted, and User-local
exceptions or markers can masquerade as Provider rejection. No selected
Provider network rejection is established by those old probes. See
[T006 production repair](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t006-production-repair-20260905.md).
After repair, 62 focused checks pass. The separate runner check retains one
obsolete expectation that a User-local Y-N-E probe should report PASS; that
test is corrected; the updated Python group has 150 PASS. A separate C++
harness link omitted the store source; the next command used a nonexistent
shortened filename. The verified source is NativeProtectedArtifactStore.cpp;
use a new directory for the corrected harness command. The unified native
build has independently completed successfully.
r4 C++ harness passes 22 cases. The r5 live entry stops before network
creation because Y-B inputs omit Y-N's FullModel role. Use the verified
five-role Y-N inputs with an explicit protected epoch for subsequent variants.

**Spec181 T004 lifecycle acceptance (2026-09-05): focused defects CLOSED.**
R1 failed before the waiter because the fixture had no running Controller
serving AA public parameters. R2 corrects that startup order and reaches the
real Provider waiter: an 80 ms wait returns false in about 6 us before run,
with SPEC181_PROVIDER_READINESS_PREMATURE_TERMINAL. The initial non-running
state was incorrectly terminal. R3 retains an OUTPUT_ROOT_MISSING preflight
failure. After the native fix/rebuild, r6 waits 83 ms and starts/stops the real
Provider; r4 reaches Controller readiness at 12.39 s; r5 cancels an active
Core probe in 2.3 ms without hot spinning. All three probes exit 0 after
process collection and network cleanup; six Core checks also pass. T004 is
complete at its focused acceptance scope; T007 remains BLOCK. See
[T004 lifecycle acceptance](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t004-lifecycle-acceptance-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T002/T004 native repair (2026-09-05): focused defects CLOSED; tasks OPEN.**
Retained failures identify group digest format, grant forwarding hint, model
basename, premature readiness, and debugger exit-code boundaries. Live-r7
uses ordinary process commands and the same rebuilt source: native protected
Y-B returns PASS/exit 0, with three ciphertext files and no ONNX plaintext or
staging remnants after cleanup. Production negatives, cancellation/resource
acceptance, source checkpoint closure and T007 remain open. See
[native launch repair](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t002-native-live-repair-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T002 production wiring (2026-09-05): build defect CLOSED; T002 OPEN.**
The first compile failed on the installed ndn-cxx forwarding-hint API. A
separate retained r2 build passes native/library/extension identity checks,
and 3 rebuilt-extension tests consume the 9 grant vectors. Real Provider
network and ORT lifecycle acceptance remains open. See
[T002 production repair](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t002-production-repair-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T002 native runtime repair (2026-09-05): focused defects CLOSED.**
18 native focused tests pass with real verification, managed content keys,
deadline/cancellation checks and retryable cleanup. Initial compile, linker
and consumption/deadline failures remain preserved. Factory, storage AEAD
and real network acceptance still keep T002 open.
See [T002 runtime repair](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t002-runtime-repair-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T001 registry repair (2026-09-05): focused defects CLOSED.**
100 focused tests plus 7 inherited grant tests pass for pinned registry
policy, private-key matching, distinct issuer/publication identities and
the final published-root allowlist. Initial RED and Python 3.8 compatibility
failures are retained. T001 network and lifecycle acceptance remains open.
See [T001 registry repair](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t001-registry-repair-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T001 Provider repair (2026-09-05): focused defects CLOSED.**
70 focused tests pass for authorization before preparation, in-memory keys,
on-disk AEAD loading, model/weights cleanup and registered-handler failures.
Registry-policy wiring and real network integration still keep T001 open.
See [T001 Provider repair](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t001-provider-repair-20260905.md).

**Spec181 T001 lifecycle repair (2026-09-05): focused defect CLOSED.** Five
RED failures are repaired; 19 focused tests pass for in-memory key leases,
duplicate protection, complete cleanup and private/symlink-safe files.
Provider integration remains open; this does not close T001.
See [T001 lifecycle repair](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/t001-lifecycle-repair-20260905.md).

**Active Spec181 audit (2026-09-05): BLOCK.** Native protected runtime wiring,
production-path negative validation and assembly parity remain unproven;
the active Context Mode plan link has been repaired. Latest retained Spec181 Y-B log
reports `CASE_RUNTIME_PROCESS_START_FAILED:control`, not a protocol result.
See [Spec181 audit repair](../specs/181-ndnsf-di-protected-grant-qualification/evidence/audit-repair-20260905.md).
Focused repair checks are allowed; full qualification requires a fresh audit PASS.

| ID | Observed | Scope | First failing boundary | Disposition | Durable record | Raw run data |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SPEC180-Y-N-R35-P-E` | 2026-09-05 | Spec180 local MiniNDN Y-N | Controller `PUBPARAMS` readiness before either negative case reached the ACK disposition path | `UNQUALIFIED`; Y-N-O/C/R/I/L passed, Y-N-P/E were not proven | [`t011-y-n-live-current-20260905-r35.md`](../specs/180-ack-driven-cross-model-qualification/evidence/t011-y-n-live-current-20260905-r35.md) | ignored workspace temporary run `spec180-yolo-y-n-current-20260905-r35/` and console log with the same run-id |

The `r35` result is the newest active blocker. Its P/E logs show the
Controller issuing `registering prefix: /example/controller` and the six
NDNSF filters, but no successful Controller-prefix registration and no
`PUBPARAMS` filter before the Python readiness timeout. This is classified as
a startup/environment boundary failure, not as an ACK disposition failure.

The ordinary `ConfigManager` message about a missing `/etc/ndn/ndnsf.conf` in
the child logs is ambient diagnostic noise for this run; it is not the
controlling failure because the successful subcases contain it as well.

## Historical pointers

These records remain useful when the current failure is related to their
boundary, but they do not advance the active gate by themselves:

- [`t013-controller-pubparams-readiness-current-20260904.md`](../specs/180-ack-driven-cross-model-qualification/evidence/t013-controller-pubparams-readiness-current-20260904.md): why the real AA `PUBPARAMS` readiness barrier exists and why the old exact-SIF result was invalidated.
- [`audit-revision123-design-code-conformance-20260904.md`](../specs/180-ack-driven-cross-model-qualification/evidence/audit-revision123-design-code-conformance-20260904.md): revision-123 design/code findings and their evidence boundary.
- [`t014-tiger-path-audit-20260904.md`](../specs/180-ack-driven-cross-model-qualification/evidence/t014-tiger-path-audit-20260904.md): Tiger-path audit block and the reasons implementation checks were not qualification evidence.
- [`t013-supervision-repair-20260904.md`](../specs/180-ack-driven-cross-model-qualification/evidence/t013-supervision-repair-20260904.md): supervision and cleanup caveats retained after the repair.

## Failure-record contract

Every failed, blocked, or `UNQUALIFIED` command that can affect task order
must produce or update a durable record before the next retry. The record must
contain:

1. a unique run/failure ID and UTC/local date;
2. the exact source/candidate/config identity and command;
3. the first failing boundary, exact marker or error, and child exit status;
4. the raw-log path plus a compact, secret-free excerpt or structured summary;
5. the affected Spec task/gate and any candidate/evidence invalidation;
6. the next allowed action and the condition that closes the failure.

Keep large logs, private keys, credentials, and transient sockets out of Git.
Use a new ignored workspace temporary directory named with a unique run-id for
each attempt; never overwrite a prior run. The durable evidence record must be
sufficient to understand the failure when the transient directory is later
unavailable.

## Closing an entry

Change the disposition only after a fresh run reaches the same boundary and
produces the required closing marker. A focused unit test can close an
implementation defect, but it cannot close a live, SIF, or Tiger gate unless
the active Spec explicitly defines that test as the gate's evidence.
